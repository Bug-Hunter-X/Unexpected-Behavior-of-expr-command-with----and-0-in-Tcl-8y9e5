This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior in Tcl's expr command when comparing a variable with 0 using the == operator. The issue arises when the variable is actually 0; the expression evaluates to 0, which is treated as false by Tcl, leading to incorrect output. The bug.tcl file contains the problematic code, and bugSolution.tcl provides a corrected version using the "!=" operator for comparison or explicit string comparison.
